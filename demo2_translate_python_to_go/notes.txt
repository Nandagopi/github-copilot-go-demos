Bad Prompt:

Convert this Python Code to Go Code

Good Prompt:
============
Context:
I have a Python class BankAccount in bank_account.py that simulates a simple checking account
with deposit and withdraw methods. I want to convert it into idiomatic Go code.

Instruction:
Convert this Python class into a Go struct with appropriate methods.

Constraints:
- Use proper Go struct with private fields.
- Return errors instead of raising exceptions.
- Maintain similar method behavior: Deposit, Withdraw, and String representation.
- Method names should be exported (capitalized) and follow Go idioms.

// Persona:
Act as a senior Go developer.

// Style:
Follow idiomatic Go practices and add GoDoc-style comments for exported methods.

----------

TakeAway:
Copilot can understand language features and convert them correctly when given proper context.
