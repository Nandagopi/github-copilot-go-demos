Bad Prompt:
==========
Add proper exception handling to this function.

Good Prompt:
==========
Context:
I have a Go function ReadLines that reads lines from a text file,
but it lacks proper error handling and does not deal with file-not-found or permission issues.

Instruction:
Refactor this function to handle file-not-found and permission errors robustly.

Constraints:
- Must return an empty slice if the file is not found.
- Must wrap permission errors with additional context and return it.
- Write the refactored version to a new function named `ReadLinesSafe` in the same file.

Persona:
Act as a senior Go developer.

Style:
Use idiomatic Go conventions; add doc comments that follow GoDoc style.
