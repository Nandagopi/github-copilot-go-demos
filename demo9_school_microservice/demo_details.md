# Demo 9 â€“ School Management Microservice (Team Demo)

This demo showcases how we can leverage GitHub Copilot to:
- Design and build a scalable **school operations microservice** in Go
- Generate APIs for managing students, teachers, academics, classes, and achievements
- Incorporate advanced logic for exams, results, and progress tracking
- Use Copilot Chat in **Ask**, **Agent**, and **Edit** modes
- Iteratively enhance the system with:
  - Concurrency analysis
  - Dockerfile & Helm chart generation
  - Changelog tracking
  - Documentation output (API docs, high-level design)

The demo illustrates how Copilot can be a **co-developer** through each phase of service creation and deployment.
