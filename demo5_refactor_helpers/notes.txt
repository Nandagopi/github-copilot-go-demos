Prompt:
===========
Context: [Optional. Add context using #selection or active editor file]
I have a Go function called ProcessTranscript in main.go that returns a word-count mapping for a chat transcript.

Instruction:
Refactor this function into the following helpers:
• cleanText(line string) string
• countTokens(tokens []string, counts map[string]int)

Constraints:
Keep the core behavior and output unchanged.

------------

TakeAway: Saw how we can refactor a long function into logical sub-functions using a natural prompt.
Benefits:
* Clear separation of concerns.
* Better readability and testability.
* No change in behavior or output—only structure improved.
