Goal:
========
To showcase how to use GitHub Copilot's `/new` slash command to bootstrap an entire Go web service from scratch.

Prompt:
========
/new

Create a complete Go web API service called `bookapi` to manage books in a library.

Requirements:
- Use idiomatic Go and standard packages (net/http)
- Provide REST endpoints: GET /books, POST /books, GET /books/{id}, PUT /books/{id}, DELETE /books/{id}
- Store books in an in-memory map or slice
- Include a README.md with build/run instructions
- Add unit tests in a `_test.go` file
- Use conventional Go folder structure

---------

Note:
You can then use `/doc`, `/tests`, and `/fix` inside each file to build out functionality.
